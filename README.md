  ## Description

  To avoid writing an entire README from scratch for each project, this markdown generator lays out a template and takes user input for project specifics to make a README in no time. Bypass the hassle of searching for your license badge, or writing the same contact instructions with each repo, and only enter the specifics to obtain the perfect README for your project.
